# Indoor-Modelling-Robotic-Path-Planning-and-Navigation
Compilation of algorithms for modelling indoor environments from 2D LiDAR point clouds, RRT-based path planning, and Gazebo ROS simulation

## Introduction
The project combines various computing principles and programming languages to provide a proof of concept of the technologies and algorithms used in the field of indoor modelling, robotic path planning, and navigation.
